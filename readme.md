## Overview (5 minutes / 0:05)

This lesson will be a refresher on the fundamentals of HTML and CSS.
All material is review from the pre-work and so will move quickly and potentially glosses over material.
For a much more robust treatment, please see [the Mozilla Developer Network Learning Area](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn).

- What are the main 3 languages that are used to create a web page?  
- What are their general roles in how a webpage displays information?

## HTML (Hyper Text Markup Language) (5 minutes / 0:10)

HTML exists to solve the problem of how a rich document can be expressed in plain text.
That is to say what are the parts of the document, what role does each part serve (e.g. heading, image, list, emphasized text, link etc.), and how do they relate to one another.

HTML expresses the **structure and semantics** of a document in plain text.

### Elements: I do (10 minutes / 0:20)

![Parts of an Element](https://mdn.mozillademos.org/files/9347/grumpy-cat-small.png)

The parts of an HTML document are called **elements** and they are denoted with **tags**.
Tags come at the beginning and end of an element's content.

![Attributes](https://mdn.mozillademos.org/files/9345/grumpy-cat-attribute-small.png)

Extra information about elements can be added using **attributes** which are added to the opening tag.
A ubiquitous element which always needs an attribute is the `a` (for *anchor*) element.
The `a` element creates a link to another location, frequently another page.

We express the structure of an HTML document by nesting.
For example, we can take a paragraph:

```html
<p>The easiest way to learn HTML is to use it!</p>
```

and we can emphasize part of the text using `em` tags:

```html
<p>The easiest way to learn HTML <em>is to use it!</em></p>
```

We can add a link to the word `HTML` that goes to the MDN HTML page (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML)

```html
<p>
  The easiest way to learn
  <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML">HTML</a>
  <em>is to use it!</em>
</p>
```

Notice the use of whitespace (line-breaks and indentation) here.
Any amount of whitespace is understood as a single space to the browser which lets us spread our content out for readability.

An element can be the child of another element (contained within its parent's tags) but can never straddle another element.

```html
<!-- Don't do this! -->
<p>The easiest way to learn HTML <em>is to use it!</p></em>
```

Similarly, do not omit closing tags.
Every element needs a closing tag (with the exception of **empty elements** which we'll discuss momentarily).

```html
<!-- Also, don't do this! -->
<p>The easiest way to learn HTML <em>is to use it!</em>
```

Browsers are extremely accommodating and so will likely display something but this behavior can't and shouldn't be depended upon.

Because the browser can be uninformatively accommodating, we want to double check our work with an [HTML validator](https://validator.w3.org/).
Even our valid example above (with the anchor tag) won't validate just yet as we are missing some required boiler plate.

### HTML Boilerplate (10 minutes / 0:30)

When a client's browser gets an HTML file from the server, it begins building a document that will be displayed to the user.

Consider the following HTML boilerplate

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <title></title>
  </head>
  <body>

  </body>
</html>
```

This is very nearly valid HTML.
The only missing requirement is content in the `title` tag.

The first line `<!DOCTYPE html>` declares that the document is an HTML document.
This is largely vestigial but necessary and not worth worrying about at the moment beyond knowing it is necessary.

The next line opens the top level element, `html` which represents the entire document.
This is the only top level element and spans the whole document.
The closing `html` tag should be the last line of the page.

The `html` element has two children, `head` and `body`.
Both `head` and `body` are required and they are the only two valid children of `html`.

#### Head

The `head` element holds **metadata** about the document; metadata meaning extra information about the document beyond the content of the document.
One required piece of metadata is the `title` element.
Every page is required to have a title; without one the HTML document is invalid.

The `meta` element declares that the *charset* or set of characters used in this document is **utf-8** which includes most characters from all known human languages.
This is not required but can avoid some problems you might run into if you use special characters.

Other examples of metadata include links to external stylesheets (more later) and scripts to run on the page.

#### Body

The `body` element contains the information actually presented to the user; it represents the content of the document.

### Valid HTML in a file: We Do (20 minutes / 0:50)

Before we start adding content to the body lets create a file locally for our work so we can open it.

Create a directory in you sandbox called `html-and-css`

```bash
cd ~/wdi/sandbox
mkdir html-and-css
cd html-and-css
```

Create a file `index.html` and open it with atom

```bash
touch index.html
atom .
```

Note: All code for this lesson is available in [this repo](https://github.com/ga-wdi-exercises/html-css-in-class/tree/master) with branches for each step.

You will see the same boilerplate from above.

Add the paragraph we used as an example to the page body and give the page a title.

Now, `index.html` should look like this:

```hmtl
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <meta charset="utf-8">
  <title>HTML &amp; CSS</title>
</head>
<body>
  <p>
    The easiest way to learn
    <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML">HTML</a>
    <em>is to use it!</em>
  </p>
</body>
</html>
```

Note: in the title we are using an [HTML entity](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Entity) for the ampersand.

This is valid HTML.
We can confirm this by copying and pasting the code into an [HTML validator](https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input).

We can also open this file in the browser by running from the command line:

```bash
open index.html
```

Wow!
Super dull!
We'll work on making this more lively shortly but first some practice fixing invalid HTML.

#### Exercise: You Do [HTML Fixit](https://git.generalassemb.ly/ga-wdi-exercises/html_fixit) (15 minutes / 1:05)

- 10 minutes working / 5 minutes review
- Work with a partner and write out plain English answers
- If you finish early, add additional HTML trying to provoke various error messages

## Break (10 mins)

### More Elements (15 minutes / 1:30)

There are tons of different HTML elements and memorizing them is impractical.
Instead, it is better to start using the 20 percent of the building blocks that get you 80 percent of the way there.
Among these are headings, paragraphs, lists, and images.

#### Headings

The `h1` - `h6` tags are for headings and subheadings.
It's rare to use past 3 or 4.

```html
<h1>I'm most important! There should really only be one of me on a page.</h1>
<h2>I'm still quite important! I'm fine being on the page a few times though</h2>
<h3>I'm pretty common!</h3>
<h4>I'm quite detailed</h4>
<h5>I'm probably deep in a menu</h5>
<h6>Wow, that's very detailed</h6>
```

#### Paragraphs

The `p` tag is used for paragraphs

```html
<p>Not a ton going on here...</p>
```

#### Lists

People love lists.
There are two types of HTML lists, ordered and unordered.

```html
<ol>
  <li>I'm first</li>
  <li>I'm second</li>
  <li>I'm third</li>
</ol>
<ul>
  <li>red</li>
  <li>green</li>
  <li>blue</li>
</ul>
```

#### Images

If there's anything people like more than lists, it's pictures.

Pictures are **empty elements** meaning that they cannot logically have children and so are represented in HTML with a single, self-closing element.
Some people put a slash at the end of empty elements but it is unnecessary.

```html
<img src="" alt="" />
<!-- is the same as -->
<img src="" alt="">
```

Images require two attributes, a `src` with a URL for an image, and an `alt` tag for screen readers and when something breaks and the image doesn't show up.

The url can be any address but generally we want to manage our own assets.

Right click the picture and click **Save image as...**, give the file a shorter name, and make sure you save it to Downloads.
I've gone with `html5logo.png`.

![HTML5 Logo](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/61/HTML5_logo_and_wordmark.svg/1024px-HTML5_logo_and_wordmark.svg.png)

Move the file from your Downloads folder to the `html-and-css` directory.

```bash
mv ~/Downloads/html5logo.png ~/wdi/sandbox/html-and-css/
```

We tell the browser to request an image and load it into the page by giving an image tag's source attribute a path to the image.

```html
<img src="html5logo.png" alt="html5 logo" >
```

### Wire Framing: I do (5 minutes / 1:35)

It is good practice to sketch up an approximation of what you'd like your end product to look like.
It's alright if it's a rough approximation.

![Rough Wireframe](https://files.slack.com/files-pri/T2D6FU4JY-F60F2QWC9/image_uploaded_from_ios.jpg?pub_secret=41dba35dd8)
...very rough approximation.

### Build Out Wireframe: You do (10 minutes / 1:45)

- 5 minutes working / 5 minutes discussing

----------------------Note: Timing is off, need to update total times-------------

## Break (5 minutes / 1:30)

## CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)

We use CSS to tell browsers how we would like for them to **paint** or display the elements of our document.

### Websites without CSS (5 minutes / 1:35)

So far the website we've created together has no CSS and is a little plain.  Let's look at some websites and take away their CSS and see how dull and plain they become.  Note that the content will still be the same, just the *styling* will be different.  

- Now lets checkout [CSS Zen Garden](http://www.csszengarden.com) to see some examples of the great power and diversity that CSS can have on a website.  

>notice, you can use the web developer tools chrome add on to take away all css on a site

### CSS File: We do (5 minutes / 2:00)

To get started writing styles we will create a new file.

```bash
touch ~/wdi/sandbox/html-and-css/style.css
```
> notice, this is an absolute path, if you're in the `html-and-css` directory you can just `touch style.css`

Then we will add a line to our HTML linking the stylesheet.

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">
```

We can test to make sure the style sheet is linked by adding a rule (we'll break down rules momentarily):

```css
body {
  background: lemonchiffon;
}
```

When we refresh the page, we should see the background color change.

### CSS Rules (5 minutes / 2:05)

CSS styles are a series of **rules** or **rulesets**.
A rule is a combination of a **selector** and a set of **declarations**.

![Anatomy of a CSS Ruleset](https://mdn.mozillademos.org/files/9461/css-declaration-small.png)

## Selector (15 minutes / 2:20)

A selector is a pattern used to match element to which the rule should apply.
As shown this can be an element.
Very commonly we add `class` or `id` attributes to elements mark for targeting by a specific rule.

Selectors can be combined and related and there are many more types of [selectors](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Introduction_to_CSS/Selectors).

**Bonus** Especially interesting are [pseudo class selectors](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Introduction_to_CSS/Pseudo-classes_and_pseudo-elements).

### Exercise: You do [CSS Diner](http://flukeout.github.io/)
- 7 minutes working / 3 minutes review

## Declaration (5 minutes / 2:25)

A declaration has two parts, a property and a value to which that property should be set.
In the example above, the property is `color` and the property value is `red`.
There must be a colon separating each property from its property value and a semicolon at the end of the declaration.
By adding just that rule to our CSS and refreshing the page in the browser, we can see the effect of the rule (though you have to scroll past the massive image -- we'll fix that shortly).

### Properties

Like HTML elements, there are tons of css properties and it is impractical to memorize them.
Again we're looking for the 20% that gets us 80% of the way.


#### [Background](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/background)

There is a ton we can do with the background of a page but for now we'll keep it simple just setting its color to off white.
Generally we will use a [**hex-triplet**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_colors#Hex_triplet) to describe colors.

Let's get back to building out our "Learn HTML" page.

In `style.css` replace the `lemonchiffon` background with:

```css
body {
  background: #F5F5F5;
}
```

**BONUS** just adding textures to a site's background can make a huge difference as well.
A great resource for free patterns is [Transparent Textures](https://www.transparenttextures.com/)

#### [Text](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Styling_text/Fundamentals)

##### [Color](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/color)

The color property sets the color of text.
An easy improvement to the default styling is to set the text color to something just off black.
For off black, we will use `#444`.

In `style.css` add the declaration to the body rule:

```css
body {
  color: #444;
  background: #F5F5F5;
}
```

##### [Font Family](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Styling_text/Fundamentals#Font_families)

An less subtle change we can easily make is to use a font other than the default `Times`.

See below for details on brining in custom fonts from Google Fonts.
For now we'll just use some of the **web safe fonts** which are available by default in most every browser. The web safe fonts are:

- Arial (sans-serif)
- Courier New (monospace)
- Georgia (serif)
- Times New Roman (serif)
- Trebuchet MS (sans-serif)
- Verdana (sans-serif)

Because there can be problems loading fonts, we provide the `font-family` property fallbacks in a comma separated list.
Also note that fonts with a space in their name need to be surrounded in quotation marks.

Let's add a declaration to the rule on body setting the font-family to a sans-serif font:

```css
body {
  color: #444;
  background: #F5F5F5;
  font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;
}
```
Notice the lower-case, dash deliminated property (sometimes called spine-case) naming convention for multi-word properties.

Let's also add a new ruleset that just applies to the `h1` and give that a monospaced font.

```css
h1 {
  font-family: "Courier New", Courier, monospace;
}
```

##### [Font size](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Styling_text/Fundamentals#Font_size)

A very common mistake is to use a header with a larger number (e.g. `h4`) for the smaller font.
This is bad practice.
Instead we want to use the heading with the appropriate meaning and then style appropriately.

Let's use a slightly smaller font for our h1 than the default `32px`:

```css
h1 {
  font-family: "Courier New", Courier, monospace;
  font-size: 24px;
}
```

**Bonus** there's a lot more you can do with [Font styling](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Styling_text/Fundamentals#Font_style_font_weight_text_transform_and_text_decoration) like text decorations and shadows!

For more detail on units of measurement in CSS check out [this Values and Units guide](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Introduction_to_CSS/Values_and_units).

##### Text Layout

###### [Text Alignment](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Styling_text/Fundamentals#Text_alignment)

Next we'll center our heading by adding a declaration setting the `text-align` value:

```css
h1 {
  font-family: "Courier New", Courier, monospace;
  font-size: 24px;
  text-align: center;
}
```

Keep in mind the text-align property will only work on text.
We will cover layout of other elements below in the discussion of the box model.

##### [Line Height](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Styling_text/Fundamentals#Line_height)

The line height property sets the size of each line.
The property value accepts any unit but is frequently seen without a unit meaning relative to the size of the font (i.e. `2` is double spaced, `1.5` is one and a half)

The default line height of `1` is a little squished.
Let's up that to `1.2` by adding a declaration to the `body` rule:

```css
body {
  color: #444;
  background: #F5F5F5;
  font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;
  line-height: 1.3;
}
```

Note: We see the space following the headings growing but it would be much more obvious with multiline paragraphs.
When we need more text than we have, we can use [Lorem Ipsum](http://www.lipsum.com/) as filler.

**BONUS** Similar to line-height, the [word-spacing and letter-spacing](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Styling_text/Fundamentals#Letter_and_word_spacing) properties can be used to adjust space around text.

Next we want to fix the obnoxiously large image but first we should review how elements relate to space with the **box model**.

## Box Model: I do (5 minutes / 2:30)

The browser represents HTML elements on the page as blocks.
Every block on the page has `width`, `height`, `padding`, `margin`, and `border` properties.
This diagram shows how these values relate to one another.

![Box Model](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/53/Css_box_model.svg)

We can see the box for an element on our page by right-clicking the element and clicking **inspect**.
Then find the **Styles** window, and scroll to the bottom.

We'll start with a new rule for images:

```css
img {
  height: 75px;
}
```

### Centering Elements: We do

One thing to note is that by default, images are **inline elements** meaning they only take up as much space as they need.

This is as opposed to **block level** elements which get their own line and take up as much space as is available to them.

To see this inline behavior we can duplicate the image and we will see it repeat left to right.

```html
<img src="html5logo.png" >
<img src="html5logo.png" >
<img src="html5logo.png" >
<img src="html5logo.png" >
<img src="html5logo.png" >
<img src="html5logo.png" >
```

In order to center the image, we want to first make it a **block level** element by setting the `display` property to `block`

```css
img {
  height: 75px;
  display: block;
}
```
Now go ahead and get rid of the extra images.

We now want to tell the block element that it should allocate extra space evenly between its margins:

```css
img {
  height: 75px;
  display: block;
  margin: 0 auto;
}
```

Much better!

### Border and Padding

Let's use a margin, border, and padding to give the body a frame.

First we'll add a rule setting a dark grey background color for the `html` element.
This will be the backdrop to our frame.

```css
html {
  background: #222;
}
```
We immediately see the dark grey around the edges of the body.
This is because body by default has margins of 8px.
We can increase this using the same margin property we use on the `img`.

```css
body {
  color: #444;
  background: url("https://www.transparenttextures.com/patterns/45-degree-fabric-light.png"), #F5F5F5;
  font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;
  line-height: 1.3;
  margin: 40px 60px;
}
```

Now let's add a border to the body:

```css
body {
  color: #444;
  background: url("https://www.transparenttextures.com/patterns/45-degree-fabric-light.png"), #F5F5F5;
  font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;
  line-height: 1.3;
  margin: 40px 60px;
  border: 5px solid skyblue;
}
```

Checking out the result in the browser, the border is a bit heavy and the color is a bit odd.
Let's use the Dev Tools to tweak this until it looks right.

We then update the value of the border property with the one we settled on:

```css
body {
  color: #444;
  background: url("https://www.transparenttextures.com/patterns/45-degree-fabric-light.png"), #F5F5F5;
  font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;
  line-height: 1.3;
  margin: 40px 60px;
  border: 3px solid #e44d26;
}
```

Now that we have a border on the body, the last thing we want to address is the contained texted jammed into the border.
The `padding` property is similar to the `margin` but instead of defining the space between the border and the external elements, it defines the space between the border and the content.

We add padding to the body as follows:

```css
body {
  color: #444;
  background: url("https://www.transparenttextures.com/patterns/45-degree-fabric-light.png"), #F5F5F5;
  font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;
  line-height: 1.3;
  margin: 40px 60px;
  border: 3px solid #e44d26;
  padding: 25px 30px;
}
```

Note: In this case we used the body as a visual container.
Frequently we will want more sub-containers for visual purposes.
The generic block element used for these purposes is the `div`.
We'll see more `div`s when we talk about using flex-box for advanced alignment.

There are many many more CSS properties and nearly no limit to what CSS will let us do but these building blocks will take us a very long way. Check out the significant difference just these 25 lines (14 declarations) of CSS have made.

The best place to go from here is to practice.
The following exercises and homework will be great for this but starting with your own wireframes, then building out the HTML and then adding CSS to create something totally new will be the best practice.

## Importing Fonts: You do (Bonus)

Google hosts a massive repository of fonts that can be imported for use on your page.

To add a font:
1. Go to [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/)
2. Click the **+** button next to any font you want to import to your page (as a rule, any more than 3 fonts in a project quickly begins to look disjointed).
3. After selecting 1 or more fonts, click the bar on the bottom that says **1 Family Selected**.
4. Add the provided link element (something like `<link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Fresca" rel="stylesheet">`) to the head of your HTML.
5. Add the provided declaration (something like `font-family: 'Fresca', sans-serif;`) to a CSS rule targeting the elements to which you would like to apply the font.
